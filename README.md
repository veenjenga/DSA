Assignment
Quiz 1 - Programming language used: Python
Quiz 1.1 - "removeDuplicates" : takes a sorted vector and modifies it to remove duplicates
Quiz1.1 - "unique index" : keeps track of the last unique element, and the loop iterates through the array
Quiz 1.2 - "rotate" : function takes the array nums and the number of steps k as inputs.
Quiz 1.3 - "containsDuplicate" : function takes an array nums as input and uses a set to keep track of unique elements.
Quiz 1.4 - "singleNumber" : function takes an array nums as input and uses the XOR operation to find the single non-repeating element.
